# Reporthole Backend — Developer Setup Guide

This guide is for team members who want to run the backend **locally for development** (coding, debugging, making changes). If you just want to test the app without coding, see [DOCKER.md](DOCKER.md) instead.

## What you need to install

| Tool | Version | Download |
|------|---------|----------|
| IntelliJ IDEA | Latest (Community or Ultimate) | https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download |
| Java JDK | 21 | https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?version=21 |
| Maven | 3.9+ | https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi — or use the IntelliJ bundled version |
| Git | Any | https://git-scm.com |
| Postman *(optional)* | Latest | https://www.postman.com/downloads |

> **Note:** You do not need PostgreSQL installed locally. The project uses H2 (an in-memory database) for local development. PostgreSQL is only used in production.

---

## 1. Clone the repo

Create a folder called `reporthole` and navigate into it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/UrbanEye-UJ/reporthole-be.git
cd reporthole/reporthole-be
```

---

## 2. Open the project in IntelliJ

1. Open IntelliJ IDEA
2. Click **File → Open** and select the `reporthole-be` folder
3. IntelliJ will detect the `pom.xml` and import it as a Maven project automatically
4. Wait for Maven to finish downloading dependencies (bottom progress bar)

---

## 3. Set up the Jasypt password

All sensitive config values (database credentials, JWT key, AES key) are encrypted using Jasypt. You need a password to decrypt them at runtime.

**Ask a teammate for the `JASYPT_ENCRYPTOR_PASSWORD` value.**

Once you have it, add it as an environment variable in IntelliJ:

1. Open the **Run/Debug Configurations** (top right dropdown → **Edit Configurations**)
2. Select your Spring Boot run configuration (or create one if it doesn't exist: **+ → Spring Boot → select main class**)
3. Click **Modify options → Environment variables**
4. Add the following:

```
JASYPT_ENCRYPTOR_PASSWORD=<password_from_teammate>
```

5. Click **Apply → OK**

> ⚠️ Never hardcode this password in any file. Never commit it to Git.

---

## 4. Set the active profile

The project uses Spring profiles. For local development, the `local` profile is already set as default in `application.yml`:

```yaml
spring:
  profiles:
    active: local
```

This means it will use H2 (in-memory database) and `application-local.yml` config automatically. You don't need to change anything.

---

## 5. Run the application

In IntelliJ, click the **green Run button** or press `Shift + F10`.

The app starts on port `8080` with context path `/api/`.

---

## 6. Verify it's running

Open your browser and check:

| URL | What it shows |
|-----|--------------|
| http://localhost:8080/api/actuator/health | Should return `{"status":"UP"}` |
| http://localhost:8080/api/swagger-ui/index.html | Interactive API documentation |
| http://localhost:8080/api/h2-console | H2 database browser (local only) |

---

## 7. H2 Console access

The H2 console lets you browse the in-memory database directly.

1. Go to http://localhost:8080/api/h2-console
2. Use the JDBC URL, username, and password from `application-local.yml`
3. Ask a teammate if you're unsure what these are (they are Jasypt-encrypted in the config)

> The H2 database resets every time you restart the app because `ddl-auto` is set to `create-drop` in the local profile. This is intentional.

---

## 8. Useful IntelliJ plugins to install

Go to **File → Settings → Plugins** and search for:

| Plugin                | Why |
|-----------------------|-----|
| **Lombok**            | Required — the project uses Lombok annotations. Without this, you'll see red errors everywhere |
| **MapStruct Support** | Helps with mapper code generation |
| **EnvFile**           | Lets you load `.env` files into run configurations |
| **EnvFile**           | Lets you load `.env` files into run configurations |
| **Maven**             | The build tool is Maven, so this helps with managing dependencies and running goals |

> After installing Lombok, go to **File → Settings → Build, Execution, Deployment → Compiler → Annotation Processors** and tick **Enable annotation processing**.
> Then restart IntelliJ to make sure Lombok is working correctly.
> Then on the folder directory do rigt click the pom file and click **Maven → Reload project** to make sure all dependencies are correctly imported.
> Then right click the pom file again and click **Maven → Generate Sources and Update Folders** to make sure all generated sources (like MapStruct mappers) are created.
> On the right side there is a maven tab (m logo) click on it there is a lifecycle option expand it and select clean install then the play button to build an artifact.
> Then you can run the application by right clicking the main class and click **Run 'ReportholeApplication'**.
